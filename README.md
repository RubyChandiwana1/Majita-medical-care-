Project Overview

Founded in 2015 by David Ndlovu and Mpumelelo Ndou, Majita Care NPO is a men-led organisation dedicated to improving men’s health, especially within black communities. The organisation was born out of deep concern after observing the alarming rate at which young men were dying from preventable health conditions such as mental health issues, high blood pressure, and complications from illegal or unsafe male circumcisions, particularly among boys and young men aged 12 to 21.
Majita Care recognises that many men in our communities often neglect their health due to stigma, misinformation, and a strong reliance on cultural beliefs over modern healthcare. Our mission is to bridge the gap between Western medicine and African traditional practices, creating a holistic and culturally respectful approach to men’s health.
We are currently working to introduce organic and alternative health solutions into hospitals and community clinics, promoting safe, accessible, and effective healthcare for all men.
